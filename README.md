# 🎮 FPS Chess - WebRTC P2P Edition

A multiplayer chess game with FPS battle mode for captures, now using **WebRTC peer-to-peer connections** for LAN gameplay!

##  Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Node.js (for running Vite dev server)
- Both players on the same LAN (Wi-Fi or Ethernet)

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

##  How to Play

### Step 1: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts Vite on `http://localhost:5173` (or similar port).

### Step 2: Host a Game

**Player 1 (Host):**
1. Open the game in your browser
2. Click **"Host Game (White)"**
3. Your local IP addresses will be displayed (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
4. Share one of these IPs with the other player
5. Wait for guest to connect

**You'll see something like:**
```
🌐 Your Local IPs:
192.168.1.100 ⭐ (en0)
10.0.0.5 (eth0)
```

The star ⭐ indicates your primary network interface (usually Wi-Fi).

### Step 3: Join as Guest

**Player 2 (Guest):**
1. Open the game in your browser (can be on a different device)
2. Enter the host's IP address in the input field
3. Click **"Join Game (Black)"**
4. Wait for connection to establish

### Step 4: Play!

Once connected:
- **White (Host)** moves first
- Click pieces to select and move (standard chess rules)
- **Captures trigger FPS battles!**
  - WASD to move
  - Mouse to aim
  - Click to shoot
  - Win the battle to win the square

##  Network Configuration (LAN-first)

- Default mode is LAN host candidates (`iceTransportPolicy: "all"`) with no TURN required. Ensure both players are on the same subnet and can reach port 8080 on the host.
- If you previously set a TURN override in `localStorage.turn_config`, clear it for LAN play:
  ```js
  localStorage.removeItem('turn_config');
  location.reload();
  ```
- If you do need TURN later, set `localStorage.turn_config` or `window.TURN_CONFIG` before loading the page:
  ```js
  localStorage.setItem('turn_config', JSON.stringify({
    iceServers: [
      { urls: ['turn:YOUR_TURN_IP:3478?transport=udp', 'turn:YOUR_TURN_IP:3478?transport=tcp'], username: 'user', credential: 'pass' }
    ],
    iceTransportPolicy: 'relay'
  }));
  location.reload();
  ```
  Replace with your TURN host/IP/creds and open/forward the TURN ports if you’re not on LAN.

### Firewall/Port Checklist (LAN)
- Host must allow inbound TCP 8080 (signaling) on the host machine.
- Browser must be allowed through OS firewall.
- TURN not needed on LAN; leave it unset unless you’re crossing networks.

## Controls

### Chess Mode
- **WASD**: Move camera
- **Space/Shift**: Up/Down
- **Mouse**: Look around
- **Click**: Select/move pieces (when it's your turn)

### Battle Mode
- **WASD**: Move in arena
- **Mouse**: Aim
- **Click**: Shoot
- Health: 100 HP (20 damage per hit)

## Architecture

### WebRTC P2P Flow

```
1. HOST STARTUP:
   ├─ Start HTTP signaling server (port 8080)
   ├─ Display local IP addresses
   ├─ Create WebRTC offer
   └─ Wait for guest

2. GUEST CONNECTION:
   ├─ Enter host IP
   ├─ Fetch SDP offer via HTTP
   ├─ Create WebRTC answer
   └─ Exchange ICE candidates

3. P2P ESTABLISHED:
   ├─ Direct data channel connection
   ├─ HTTP signaling server shuts down
   └─ All game data flows peer-to-peer
```

### State Management

- **Host (White)**: Game state authority, validates all moves
- **Guest (Black)**: Sends move requests, receives authoritative state
- **Battle Mode**: Distributed authority (each player calculates own damage)

### Data Channels

1. **"game-state"** (Reliable, Ordered)
   - Chess moves
   - Battle start/end
   - Game state updates

2. **"battle-updates"** (Unreliable, Unordered)
   - Real-time position updates (50ms interval)
   - Shooting/health data
   - Lower latency for smooth FPS gameplay

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection failed: timeout"

**Causes:**
- Host hasn't started yet
- Wrong IP address entered
- Firewall blocking port 8080
- Not on same network

**Solutions:**
1. Verify both devices on same Wi-Fi/ethernet
2. Double-check IP address is correct
3. Try pinging host IP: `ping 192.168.1.100`
4. Disable firewall temporarily or allow browser through firewall

### Firewall Configuration

**macOS:**
```
System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Firewall
→ Firewall Options → Allow your browser
```

**Windows:**
```
Windows Defender Firewall → Allow an app
→ Add your browser (Chrome/Firefox/etc)
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
```

### "No local IPs displayed"

- Check you're connected to a network (Wi-Fi or ethernet)
- Try restarting the browser
- Check network adapter is enabled

### Laggy Battle Mode

- Ensure strong Wi-Fi signal (or use ethernet)
- Close bandwidth-heavy apps (streaming, downloads)
- Reduce distance between devices on LAN
- Check for network interference

### State Desync

If board states differ between players:
- Host periodically sends full state sync (every 5 seconds)
- Guest always accepts host's state as truth
- Connection drops will require reconnection

## Testing on Same Computer

You can test with two browser windows on the same machine:

1. Open first window: Click "Host Game"
2. Note the IP (will show `127.0.0.1` or local IP)
3. Open second window (or incognito): Enter `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
4. Click "Join Game"

## Technical Details

### WebRTC Configuration

```javascript
iceServers: [
  { urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' },
  { urls: 'stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302' }
]
```

STUN servers help with NAT traversal, even on LANs.

### Message Protocol

All messages are JSON over WebRTC Data Channels:

```javascript
// Guest sends move request
{ type: 'moveRequest', fromRow: 6, fromCol: 4, toRow: 4, toCol: 4 }

// Host broadcasts game state
{ type: 'gameState', board: [[...]], currentTurn: 'black' }

// Battle update (50ms interval)
{ type: 'battleUpdate', position: {x,y,z}, rotation: {x,y,z}, shot: {...}, health: 80 }
```

### Performance Metrics

- **Connection Time**: < 5 seconds
- **Move Latency**: < 200ms
- **Battle Update Rate**: 20 updates/sec (50ms interval)
- **Battle Latency**: < 100ms
- **Data Usage**: ~2KB per move, ~150 bytes per battle update


##  Known Limitations

- No internet gameplay (LAN only)
- No spectator mode
- No game save/resume
- No reconnection after disconnect (must restart)
- No check/checkmate detection (simplified chess rules)
- No en passant, castling, or pawn promotion
